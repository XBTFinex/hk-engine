I am a software engineer with over 7 years of experience designing, building
and testing platforms and apis using a variety of frameworks, languages and
architectures. My main platforms for implementation and prototyping are the
JVM (Java, Scala), NodeJS, React and Angular. My most prominent and advocated
architectures are REST APIs, TDD and recently i've been interested on
researching and learning more about microservices.

After 2 years of research into distributed systems and resilient networks i
end up discovering the bitcoin network and everything changed since them. I am
convinced the world will end up switching to these distributed networks that
delivers value through community collaboration with protection via chains of
cryptographic signatures - blockchain, and the main impact will be on the
financial industries, with increased transparency, reduced settlement time,
cost and increased access to modern banking for those who cannot afford it.

XBTFinex is a startup that intends to bring the power of blockchain systems,
the bitcoin and ethereum networks to the financial world, mainly through a
resilient and connected platform for capital markets that offers novel
financial instruments, derivative contracts, online trading, fast settlement
on the blockchain, business intelligence, extensive reports, realtime data
feeds, and crossborder payments.

Open source drives the way i think, the way i learn and the way i see the
world.
I really do believe Open Source applications and Open platforms will be the
future and lead us to a better use of collective effort.
